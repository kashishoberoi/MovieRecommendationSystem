# MovieRecommendationSystem
- Web Technologies Project
- Recommender systems are algorithms designed to help users discover movies, products, and songs by predicting the userâ€™s rating of each item and displaying similar items that they might rate high as well. The objective is to show customers content that they would like best based on their historical activity.
- Movies are the best source of entertainment of this era and specially during this quarantine time. Many of us find it difficult to decide which movie to watch and so we decided to make a recommender system for us to better judge which movie we are more likely to love.
- In this project we are going to use Machine Learning Algorithms to recommend movies to users based on genres and user ratings.
